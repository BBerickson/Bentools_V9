  load file(s)
    Ueses deeptools matrix files (.gz works)
    can load a file containg a list of file names ... requres file end in .url.txt
      along with path to file you can add some meta data: 543/5/3/PI, nickname,  rgb or hex plot color
          path/b.matrix.gz 5 b #00FF00
        files can be local or remote
      
    sets some defalt plot options based on the first file loaded and provided meta data
      
  load gene lists 
    one colunm.txt/.bed or must have a "gene" named column, can have # comment lines
      if no gene names match can re-try with partial matching,
        if no gene names match auto re-try with partial matching
      
  save gene
    save selected gene list to txt file
       a commentted section is added of the tool's settings used to make the list
    
QC/Options tab      
  
  select gene list and file
    select plot line and dot type
    select color by rgb or hex
    plot legend label "nickname", to reset leave blank when button is pushed
    apply normilization factor that is applied as needed and passed on to children lists
    remove file from all gene lists
    
  

Norm tab

  select a file and one to noromalize by
    select divide gene by gene or bin by bin
    select replacing #/0 = Inf with psudo count
  or to combinde files  
    adds new "data file"
    
Plot tab

  first time runs plotting functions are run and a plot is produced
  quick set default plot x axis bin lables
  drop down selection(s) of data restricted to gene list to be plotted
  sliders and selectors for x and y plot axis
  set math and normalization to data for plotting
  quick color setting
  cusome set x axis bin lables
  lines and labels tool helps place proper, can edit lable and posistion pairs

Gene tool

  compare gene lists and report intercected, unique, and total 
  
Sort tool

  select gene list and file(s) for that list
  select bin range to work on
  select top/bottom rank % cut off or Quick sort button
    Quick sort removes top and bottom % outliers
  
  returns data table
    search data table
    sort on each file
    additional filter on rank % (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists
    action button builds datatable and shows
    
Ratio tool
  
  select gene list and  2 files for that list
  select bin range(s) to work on
  select fold change cut off
  can norm data to a bin
  preforms a[1]/b[2] or (a[1]/a[2])/(b[1]/b[2])
  
  returns 3 data tables with fold cut off for each file and non fold cut off 
    search and sort data table
    additional filter on fold cut off (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists
    
  action button builds datatable and shows
  
cluster tool
  
  select gene list and 1 file form that list (must have at least 4 genes)
  select bin range(s) to work on
  select fold number of clusters/groups 1-4 
  
  preforms hierarchical clustering using ward method
    search and sort data table
    additional filter on fold cut off (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists 
  
  preforms grouping ...
    search and sort data table
    additional filter on fold cut off (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists 
    
    action button builds datatable and shows
    action button shows plot results for selected file
    
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) tool
  
  select files from gene lists (except CDF)
  select bin 5' and 3' ranges
  select upper and lower percentages to exclude
  select to use in common gene lists or not
  
  plots results
    if 2 files are use a ks test p value is returned and the diffrence between the two in the data table
    reactive to upper and lower percentages and updates gene list
    if same file from differnt gene lists is used cdf plot colors will be auto replaced
    
  action button builds datatable and shows
    search and sort data table
    results are added to gene list and updates plot
