Load Data tab

  load file(s)
    Ueses deeptools matrix files (.gz works)
    can load a file containg a list of file names ... requres file end in .url.txt
      along with path to file you can add some meta data: 543/5/3/PI, nickname,  rgb or hex plot color
          path/b.matrix.gz 5 b #00FF00
        files can be local or remote
      
    sets some defalt plot options based on the first file loaded and provided meta data
      
  load gene lists 
    one colunm.txt/.bed or must have a "gene" named column, can have # comment lines
      if no gene names match can re-try with partial matching,
        if no gene names match auto re-try with partial matching
      
  save gene
    save selected gene list to txt file
       a commentted section is added of the tool's settings used to make the list


Plot tab

  first time 
    opens box showing deeptools selections prevewing x axix labels 
      can set TSS TES naming and how many tiks 
    the first two files are selected to plot auto
  drop down selection/deselection of samples to plot for the diffrent gene lists
  menu's for 
    sliders and selectors for x and y plot axis
    set math and normalization to data for plotting
    group ploting means of means
    color setting
    x axis bin TSS TES labels tiks 
      can edit lable and posistion pairs
   
    
QC/Options tab      
  
  select a file
    plot "quadrille" or 
    "low range percentile" or
    "braod range percentile" or
    "% 0's per bin","quadrille"

Filter tab

  filter origonal gene size and spacing

  select gene list and file(s) for that list
  select bin range to work on
  select top/bottom rank % cut off or Quick sort button

  returns data table
    search data table
    sort on each file
    additional filter on rank % (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists
    action button builds datatable and shows
    
Ratio tab
  
  select gene list and  2 files for that list
  select bin range(s) to work on
  select fold change cut off
  can norm data to a bin
  preforms a[1]/b[2] or (a[1]/a[2])/(b[1]/b[2])
  
  returns 3 data tables with fold cut off for each file and non fold cut off 
    search and sort data table
    additional filter on fold cut off (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists
    
  action button builds datatable and shows
  
cluster tab
  
  select gene list and 1 file form that list (must have at least 4 genes)
  select bin range(s) to work on
  select fold number of clusters/groups 1-4 
  
  preforms hierarchical clustering using ward method
    search and sort data table

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) tab
  
  select files from gene lists (except CDF)
  select bin 5' and 3' ranges
  select upper and lower percentages to exclude
  select to use in common gene lists or not
  
  plots results
    if 2 files are use a ks test p value is returned and the diffrence between the two in the data table
    reactive to upper and lower percentages and updates gene list
    if same file from differnt gene lists is used cdf plot colors will be auto replaced
